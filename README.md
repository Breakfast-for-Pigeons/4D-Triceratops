## Instructions

1) Connect the Rasberry Pi, T. rex motor, and electronics as shown in the image below. If you installed the Fritzing application, I included my 4D_Triceratops.fzz file. Feel free to use it. NOTE: The image shows only 2 AA batteries. I actually used 4 AA batteries for this project.



2) Download the Zip file or clone this project with git.
